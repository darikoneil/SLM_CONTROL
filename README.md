The modules in `optics` are forward engineered for both understanding dual-beam SLM configurations 
& potential future use. The code quality is highly variable. Minor portions are copy/pasted from
`neurobeam`. Anything good will eventually get polished, tested, & merged into `neurobeam`'s optics 
module and the rest will be left to rot.


The initial `spatial_light_modulator` module was from when I was reverse engineering 
slm stuff to understand things before `slmsuite`. These are completely untested and I don't 
plan to ever test them. They don't have a backend for meadowlark PCIe-connected SLMs, 
so I wrote my own and will get around to push/testing it. Assuming that that feature 
will be pushed expediently, we can use `slmsuite` as an interface to make any SLM operations 
hardware-agnostic.
